# ZIP File Password Cracker

This script is a simple script that uses the 'jszip' package in javascript to open a zip file called "test.zip" and reads a text file called "password.txt" which contains a list of potential passwords. It then tries to extract the contents of the zip file using the decrypt() function, and the password passed to the function as the argument password. If the password is correct, the script will print "Password Found: <password>" and stop the iteration. If the password is incorrect it will print "Trying......." and move to the next password until the correct password is found or the end of the file is reached.

## How to prevent it?
* Strong Passwords: Use strong and unique passwords for all the files that you want to protect. Avoid using easily guessable information such as personal data, common words or patterns.

* Encryption: Use encryption to secure the files that you want to protect. This will make it extremely difficult for an attacker to access the contents of the file.

* Two-Factor authentication: Use two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security for your files.

* Keep software up to date: Make sure that all software and devices on the network are up to date with the latest security patches. This will help to prevent vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker.

* Monitor logs: Keep an eye on the system logs and look for any suspicious activity. This will help you to identify any potential attempts to crack your password-protected files and take action to prevent them.
It's important to note that cracking password protected files is not a secure or ethical practice and should be avoided. As a user or developer, it's important to take the necessary steps to protect your files with strong passwords, encryption and other security measures.
